Based on the Freetronics ProtoShieldShort
<http://www.freetronics.com/pss>

A specially shaped prototyping shield for the Arduino, designed to be
able to clear the RJ45 jack and a PoE Module on an Ethernet Shield
or Freetronics EtherTen. Includes space for a MAC address chip.

Features:

 * Designed to fit a Freetronics EtherTen with an 802.3af PoE module
   installed, or a standard Ethernet Shield.
 * Arduino "R3" header layout.
 * Surface mount pads for an I2C connected EEPROM with built in MAC
   address (MicroChip 24AA02E48).
 * Pads for reset button connected to Arduino reset pin.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.
